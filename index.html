        <h1>What a wonderful world</h1>
        <h3>by Louis Armstrong</h3>
        <p>I see trees of green,<br>
            Red roses too. <br>
            I see them bloom, <br>
            For me and you. <br>
            And I think to myself, <br> 
            What a wonderful world!
        </p>
        <p>I see skies of blue, <br>
            And clouds of white. <br>
            The bright blessed day, <br>
            The dark sacred night. <br>
            And I think to myself, <br>
            What a wonderful world! 
        </p>
        <p>The colours of the rainbow, <br> 
            So pretty in the sky. <br>
            Are also on the faces, <br>
            Of people going by. <br>
            I see friends shaking hands,<br> 
            Sayin': "How do you do?"<br>
            They're really sayin' <br>
            "I love you". 
        </p>
        <p>I hear babies cryin', <br>
            I watch them grow. <br>
            They'll learn much more, <br> 
            Than I'll ever know. <br>
            And I think to myself, <br>
            What a wonderful world! 
        </p>
        <p>Yes... <br>
            I think to myself, <br> 
            What a wonderful world!
        </p>
